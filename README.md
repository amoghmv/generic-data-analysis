MV AMOGH - amoghmv

## What I used?
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sckit-learn, mysql.connector)
- MySQL
- Power BI

This repository contains SQL and Python-based analytics using packages like pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, sckit-learn to help gather business insights and solve problems.
The file **insights_through_analysis.pdf** is the report that includes everything related to the analysis, business insights, business recommendations and suggestions.

**File name - python_code_analysis.ipynb**
              AND
              **sql_code_analysis.sql** includes code used for the analysis to answer the following business questions:

1. **Lead Generation Efficiency** (SQL)

Ratio of leads generated to time spent — who is most efficient?

2. **Daily Performance Variability** (SQL)

8. **Optimal Time Threshold**  (SQL)
<img width="315" height="118" alt="MYSQL AG Q8" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/251bcead-ce29-474e-b644-1178a8e0d7d7" />

Is there a “sweet spot” for time spent that boosts leads?

9. **Weekday vs Weekend Performance** (SQL)  
<img width="346" height="222" alt="MYSQL AG Q9" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c682de61-9ee9-467a-b460-484d15c2a559" />

Simple linear regression to predict leads based on time spent

The next section to this report is the static dashboard.
**File name - python_dashboard_code.ipynb** contains the Python code used for visualisation of data (only boxplot and heatmap via python)
Reference to this link can also be made to look into the static dashboard image.

**1. Impact of Daily Team Reviews** (POWER BI)
Line chart comparing daily leads generated on days attneded vs missed team reviews, per associate.

**2. Optimal Time Threshold** (PYTHON, SEABORN, MATPLOTLIB)
Heatmap showing how average leads vary across time buckets (e.g. 0–60, 61–120 min).

**3. Monthly Performance Comparison** (POWER BI)
Clustered bar chart showing total leads generated per associate across different months.


**5. Incomplete Leads Trend** (POWER BI)
Line chart tracking daily incomplete leads to analyze spikes and recovery patterns.
